# :heart: Community Center
This repository houses a few important resources for community members and those who want to contribute or join.

## :handshake: How to join
The Slimefun Addon Community is an open source community centered around the [@Slimefun](https://github.com/Slimefun/) project.

We are a small community of developers who share and exchange ideas, resources, tutorials, code and help each other.<br>
The focus of this group is to work on projects together, to collaborate and work out new ideas and concepts.

Anybody is welcome, if you want to become a member of the "Slimefun Addon Community" organization, simply [create a new Issue in this Repository and select the "Application letter" template](https://github.com/Slimefun-Addon-Community/Community-Center/issues/new/choose).
Fill in the template, how you got to know this community, what you expect from us and what projects you want to work on or start.<br>
But don't get intimidated, this is an open and inclusive community, anyone is welcome.

*At this point in time, only developers who have already released an addon for Slimefun will be accepted. This might change later once this organization has grown a bit.*

## :open_book: Benefits
**Why should I become a member of this organization?**<br>
You don't have to become a member, it is completely optional.<br>
But members of this organization get a few benefits for their open-source contributions.
* Access to our private repositories (templates, documents and other stuff)
* The ability to collaborate with other members (Create teams, invite other members into your project)
* Gathering feedback from other members (Need a second opinion? Request a pull request review from other organization members!)

This GitHub organization is heavily centered around the [Teams](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/about-teams) feature of GitHub.

## :bulb: Our goals
We want to provide a place where ideas, feedback and knowledge is shared with others (organization member or not).<br>
The main focus is the development of Slimefun addons of course but it is more about pulling everyone closer together. To create teams, to collaborate, to work together on solutions for problems.

This organization is also seperated from the main [@Slimefun](https://github.com/Slimefun/) organization to give addon creators a safe space to collaborate and work in teams.<br>
Addon creators are in full control over their repositories and we ([@Slimefun](https://github.com/Slimefun/)) won't get in anybody's way here, unless someone explicitly asks us to step in. This is for the community and by the community.

Thanks for reading :heart:
